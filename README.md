email nominations are automatically handled with a cloudflare email worker ü™Ñ

#### tui

build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/linuxunsw/vote.git
cd ./vote/tui
go build -o vote cmd/vote/main.go
./vote
```

additionally, for development:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/linuxunsw/vote.git
cd ./vote/tui
go run cmd/vote/main.go
```

the tui interface is made to be served over ssh, and will do so by default. to run locally without ssh, include the following in your `config.yaml` (see [configuration](tui/README.md)):

```yaml
# config.yaml
tui:
  local: true
```
